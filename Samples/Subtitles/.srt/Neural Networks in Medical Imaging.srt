00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,600
Imagine a world where medical diagnoses are faster, more accurate,

2
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:10,980
and more accessible.

3
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:15,535
This is becoming a reality thanks to the power of

4
00:00:15,535 --> 00:00:19,180
artificial intelligence, specifically neural networks, in medical imaging.

5
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:23,585
For years, doctors have relied on tools like X-rays, MRIs,

6
00:00:23,585 --> 00:00:27,110
and CT scans to visualize the human body.

7
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:30,882
Now, neural networks are taking these images to the next

8
00:00:30,882 --> 00:00:30,882

9
00:00:30,882 --> 00:00:35,325
Neural networks are a type of AI that excels at

10
00:00:35,325 --> 00:00:39,768
pattern recognition. Think of them as incredibly sophisticated image analysis

11
00:00:39,768 --> 00:00:39,768

12
00:00:39,768 --> 00:00:43,789
They are trained on massive datasets of medical images, learning

13
00:00:43,789 --> 00:00:47,810
to identify subtle patterns and anomalies that might be invisible

14
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:49,418
to the human eye.
