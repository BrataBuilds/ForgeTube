# ForgeTube Video Assembler
The current video assembler, built using **`MoviePy`** (which relies on **`FFmpeg`** for video processing), takes all images from the ***Images*** folder and all audio files from the** *Audio*** folder and combines them into a single video. Each image is displayed for the exact duration of its corresponding audio file, ensuring perfect synchronisation between visuals and sound.  

Both images and audio files are sorted alphabetically before being compiled in sequence. To maintain the correct order, it is recommended to name the files numerically (e.g., `01.jpg`, `01.mp3`, `02.jpg`, `02.mp3`, etc.).

## Get started 
1. Clone the repo on your system.
2. create a python virtual environment.
3. Install the following dependencies 

> Install MoviePy via `pip install moviepy`.
> 
> Install FFmpeg from [here](https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html)
